# Nigerian News Sites Network Analysis - Data Collection

Welcome to the first of three repositories for the network analysis of Nigerian news agencies. This repository focuses on data collection, which involves obtaining news articles links and downloading their contents for further processing to create the network's edge list.

## Files and Overview:

1. **news_articles.py**

   This script (`news_articles.py`) is the starting point for data collection. It uses the Google package to fetch a list of articles and their corresponding links from various Nigerian news sites. The collected data is then stored in CSV files, with each file representing a news agency. These CSV files are saved in the "news_data" folder.

2. **clean_articles.py**

   The `clean_articles.py` script contains functions that handle the cleaning process for the raw news data obtained from `news_articles.py`. It reads the CSV files from the "news_data" folder and applies data cleaning operations, including removing duplicates and ensuring data accuracy. The cleaned data is saved as new CSV files in the "news_cleaned" folder.

3. **download_articles.py**

   In `download_articles.py`, the cleaned and merged CSV files generated by `clean_articles.py` are loaded. Using the newspaper package, this script downloads the full content of the listed articles for further processing in creating the network's edge list. The downloaded article content is saved as separate text files in the "articles" folder for efficient storage and handling.

## Steps for Data Collection:

1. Run `news_articles.py` to obtain a list of news articles and their corresponding links from various Nigerian news sites. The data will be saved in CSV files within the "news_data" folder, with each file representing a news agency.

2. Execute `clean_articles.py` to clean the raw news data stored in the "news_data" folder. The script will remove duplicate rows and perform necessary data cleaning operations, saving the cleaned data as new CSV files in the "news_cleaned" folder.

3. Run `download_articles.py` to download the full content of the news articles from the cleaned CSV files using the newspaper package. The downloaded article content will be saved as separate text files in the "articles" folder.

4. The downloaded article content in the "articles" folder, along with the cleaned CSV files in the "news_cleaned" folder, provide the necessary data for further processing in the next repositories. This data will be used to create the network's edge list and perform network analysis on Nigerian news agencies.

Please refer to the individual scripts for more detailed comments and explanations about each step of the data collection process. After successfully completing this data collection phase, proceed to the next repository in the series to create the network's edge list and delve into network analysis on Nigerian news agencies. Happy analyzing!
